					<li>The hero extricates himself using HIS OWN SKILL, training or brawn.</li>
					<li>The mysteries remaining--one big one held over to this point will help grip interest--are cleared up in course of final conflict as hero takes the situation in hand.</li>
					<li>Final twist, a big surprise, (this can be the villain turning out to be the unexpected person, having the "Treasure" be a dud, etc.)</li>
					<li>The snapper, the punch line to end it.</li>
